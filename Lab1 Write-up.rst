What was the hardest part of this lab?
 Everything was hard to me on this first Lab.
During the course of this lab, why did we exclude .pyc files?
 The .pyc files are byte code and not needed in source control. These kind of files are ok only if they are going to be more or  less static.
Name three files which would likely need to have a gitignore added?
 .exe, .pyc, .html
What is a pyunit TestCase?
 A TestCase should test one function, where all the test steps or methods should test a particular portion of the code.
What is the difference between a git cherry pick and a rebase?
 Rebase will merge one branch with the current branch you're in. Cherry pick is similar to that but it can merge a commit in  another branch rather than the entire branch.
How could you use git to print out just the author name of a given file for the current version of the repo?
 git log -p filename
During this lab did you explore Tortoise Git or GIT Extensions? If not take a look at them, they probably would be useful for the remainder of the class 
Did you find the second issue in get_triangle_type? Did you choose to test the code as is or fix the code in get_triangle_type
